Roger Federer is a Swiss former professional tennis player widely regarded as one of the greatest ever. Born August 8, 1981, in Basel, he turned pro in 1998 and retired in September 2022. In LV's Core Values campaign, he appears alongside Nadal, carrying the Monogram Christopher backpack for an elegant, sporty look. For a stylish touch, consider the Monogram Tambour watch, the Pochette Crossbody bag, or the LV Twist MM handbag, each embodying the perfect blend of elegance and sophistication.
